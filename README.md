# Majoritarian Simulation Project

## Description
This project simulates policy impacts on populations under various scenarios, including elite, random, and centralized (capture) policy distributions. It includes tools for:

- Generating population grids with policy impacts.
- Visualizing inequality using heatmaps, Lorenz curves, and Gini coefficients.
- Summarizing and exporting results for further analysis.

---

## Features
- Simulates three policy impact scenarios: `elite`, `random`, and `capture`.
- Generates Gini coefficients to measure inequality.
- Visualizes results with heatmaps, Lorenz curves, and policy coverage plots.
- Provides summary statistics and exports results for easy analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- Required R packages: `tidyverse`, `patchwork`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/majoritarian-simulation.git
   cd majoritarian-simulation
   ```
2. Install dependencies in R:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "patchwork"))
   ```
3. Ensure the `R` directory contains all helper files and the `main.R` script is in the root directory.
4. Create an `output` directory in the root folder to store results and visualizations.

---

## Usage

### Run Simulations
1. Open `main.R` in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
2. Run the entire script to:
   - Generate policy impact simulations.
   - Visualize results.
   - Save Gini coefficients and visualizations to the `output` directory.

### Results Processing
1. The results (Gini coefficients) are stored in `output/gini_results.csv`.
2. Summary statistics and visualizations are automatically generated by `results.R`:
   - Gini summary: `output/gini_summary.csv`
   - Gini plot: `output/gini_plot.svg`
